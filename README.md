Quick Overview
---------------

This program uses the internal API of the GW2 trading post to monitor pricing trends of items on the market. This program was created for pure enjoyment and to allow personal customization on the tracking methods used.

> Note, the program uses an _intenral_ API, thus you need an account within GW2 to get a session key to talk to the API. 

Getting Started
---------------

This program is written in Python. It was written against Python 2.7.3. The GUI is written in PyQT4.

So you will need:

 * [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
 * [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
 
>You may need to install [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) before you can install the above dependancies.

Once you have everything installed, run:
    `> path\to\python GW2TPMonitor.py`

Drawbacks and Limitations
-------------------------

This program is not here to replace services like GW2Spidy. For a more fully featured mainstream solution, (and you don't need your own account) try that option.
